      "readme": "When I embarked on this project, my primary objective was to develop a personalized time management tool that would enhance my productivity at work. During my research phase, I came across a captivating book called 'BlockSix', which expounded on a unique time management methodology that deeply resonated with me. <br><br> Intrigued and inspired by the book, I reached out to the author to seek permission to incorporate their methodology into my project. Not only did I aspire to create a tool based on their insights, but I also believed that engaging with the author would serve as a powerful source of motivation throughout the project. Fortunately, the author generously granted me permission, further fueling my enthusiasm. <br><br> Although this project was predominantly a solo endeavor, due to its nature as a time management tool, I decided to leverage GitHub Issues to effectively track and plan my work. This approach proved invaluable in organizing and prioritizing tasks, ensuring a structured and systematic development process. <br><br> Additionally, I viewed this project as an opportunity to update and expand my technical skill set. Therefore, I chose to implement the latest tech stack embraced by the Laravel community, including Vue 3, Inertia.js, and Pinia. By utilizing these cutting-edge technologies, I aimed to enhance the performance, user experience, and maintainability of the time management tool I was building.",
